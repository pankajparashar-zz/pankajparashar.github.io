    Giant ascii art embedded in every page of your site is how you
    show other people that YOU CARE. Mainly I care about developers,
    which is what I presume you are if you're all about viewing
    the source. Clearly you're my kind of person.

    This is v4, it's run through Jekyll, it's been fun to build,
    there's always more to do, and you may notice that aside from
    Google Analytics there is no JavaScript. None.

    That's one way of many you keep your pages fast. I care about
    keeping this site fast because your time is precious and I need
    to get out of your way.

It will be help at London’s Grand Connaught Rooms on 9 May.</figcaption></figure></p><h3>TEAM AWARDS</h3><p></p><p><strong>New Agency of the Year</strong> - None<br>Couldn't choose anyone as all the nominees this year were completely new to me. To be fair, I chose not to vote.</p><p><strong>Team of the Year</strong> - Squarespace<br>The folks at <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> have done an incredible job in the past one year and their designs have always been a great source of inspiration for me.</p><p><strong>Agency of the Year</strong> - FFFunction<br>Hands down, <a href="http://fffunction.co/">FFFunction</a> beat everyone by a distance. If you are still unsure why, then you should checkout their list of achievments in 2013 on <a href="http://year.fffunction.co/">this site</a>.</p><h3>INDIVIDUAL AWARDS</h3><p></p><p><strong>Entrepreneur of the Year</strong> - Evan Williams<br>Serial entrepreneur <a href=https://medium.com/@ev>Evan Williams</a>, is the force behind Blogger, when he was at Google. Then he started with Twitter and now Medium. He sure as hell knows how to sell his products and deservedly earns my vote for Entrepreneur of the year award.</p><p><strong>Emerging Talent of the Year</strong> - None<br>No clue here, hence, would reserve my right to vote.</p><p><strong>Young Developer of the Year</strong> - Harry Roberts<br>I have been following <a href="http://csswizardry.com/">Harry</a> for years now and his work on <a href="http://inuitcss.com/">inuit.css</a> has been a great inspiration for me and I consider it an encyclopedia of CSS.</p><p><strong>Young Designer of the Year</strong> - Dan Eden<br>After watching <a href="http://daneden.me/">Dan</a> over the years publishing side projects, months after moths and now a full time designer at Dropbox, I had no doubt in my mind before casting the vote for this category.</p><p><strong>Developer of the Year</strong> - Hakim El Hattab<br>A tough group to chose from, but <a href="http://hakim.se/">Hakim</a> won it in the end. I still remember his experiment on <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/hakim/Ht6Ym/">3D rollover links</a> that I shamelessly copied for one of my projects. Since, then he has built great apps like, <a href="http://sketchtoy.com/">SketchToy</a>, <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/fokus/">Fokus</a> and <a href="http://slid.es/">Slides</a>.</p><p><strong>Designer of the Year</strong> - Tim Van Damme<br>My vote was decided on the day when I read <a href="http://maxvoltar.com/">Tim's</a> interview on <a href=http://thegreatdiscontent.com/tim-van-damme>The Great Discontent</a>. An incredible genuine guy with a such modest background. Didn't have to think twice before casting the vote.</p><p><strong>Outstanding Contribution of the Year</strong> - Chris Coyier<br>Having interacted with <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris</a>, while writing few guest posts on <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, I am confident that he is doing a great job in serving the community by writing web design and development tutorials and articles on CSS Tricks.</p><h3>COMMUNITY AWARDS</h3><p></p><p><strong>Podcast of the Year</strong> - Shoptalk<br>Dave and Chris are funny and their guest list is very impressive. Also this is the only podcast that I listen to, hence, I am biased to vote for them.</p><p><strong>Conference Talk of the Year</strong> - Mike Monteiro<br>One of the most fearsome and outspoken man in the web industry, comes out to present, "How designers destroyed the world?". I am so overwhelmed with this talk, that I am embedding it here, so that you can watch it and become equally mesmerized.</p><!-- FitMyVideo --><div class=Flexible-container><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/68470326?color=a05" width=500 height=281 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href=http://vimeo.com/68470326>Webstock '13: Mike Monteiro - How Designers Destroyed the World</a> from <a href=http://vimeo.com/webstock>Webstock</a> on <a href=https://vimeo.com>Vimeo</a>.</p><p>You are directly responsible for what you put into the world. Yet every day designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This needs to change.</p></div><p><strong>Grassroots Event of the Year</strong> - None<br>Did not visit any of them and hence, I am not the right persone to vote for this category.</p><h3>PROJECT AWARDS</h3><p></p><p><strong>Best Online Portfolio</strong> - Michiel de Graaf<br>I love <a href="http://michieldegraaf.com/">Micheil's</a> portfolio website and enjoyed the amount of details described in each of his project, right from the typography to the different gradients of the same color.</p><p><strong>Side Project of the Year</strong> - Can I Use<br>I'm surprised this project is still in Beta, even after being available to devs for more than a year. It is amazingly useful and incredibly simple to understand. Hence, it gets my vote.</p><p><strong>Demo of the Year</strong> - Chris Ruppel<br>All the demos in this category are great but only few of them actually serve as a tutorial for developers to understand. I liked Chris's <a href="http://rupl.github.io/unfold/">CSS 3D Transforms</a> very much and loved how they were used to make your DOM elements jump out of the flatland.</p><p><strong>Best Collaborative Project</strong> - The Techcrunch Redesign<br>An all start-studded team assembled by Josh Clark including Dan Mall, Brad Frost, Jennifer Brook, Jonathan Stark and Kristina Frantz. The <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/techcrunch-responsive-redesign/">Techcrunch Redesign</a> is an outcome of the efforts invested by a bunch of talented individuals.</p><p><strong>Redesign of the Year</strong> - Flickr<br>Yahoo’s ‘new photo experience’ is big, bold and beautiful. In the reanimating, user's photographs now take central stage. Gone, are acres of white space and text. Now, content shines as do the site’s social sharing mechanism and rightfully earns my vote.</p><h3>TECHNOLOGY AWARDS</h3><p></p><p><strong>Game changer of the Year</strong> - Sass<br>After <a href="http://pankajparashar.com/posts/why-do-i-hate-css-preprocessors/">avoiding CSS preprocessors</a> for year, I've grown in love with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and cannot imagine my CSS without it. Hence, this certainly is a game changer for me, if not for anyone else.</p><p><strong>Best new web technology</strong> - BEM<br>Although <a href="http://bem.info/">BEM</a> doesn't really qualify as a technology, but it surely has redfined the way I write CSS. Block Element Modifier was thought up by Yandex. It’s a front-end naming methodology for CSS. It lets you name your CSS, giving them meaning and transparency when examined by other developers.</p><p><strong>Open Source project of the Year</strong> - Yeoman<br>This one was easy! Having used <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> for more than year now, I think I am in a perfect position to judge this app and in my mind this surely is a winner.</p><p><strong>App of the Year</strong> - Sublime Text<br>This one was a tough one for me; especially chosing between <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="http://hammerformac.com/">Hammer for Mac</a>. But Sublime Text emerged out as the winner solely because it is the best editor out there, IMO and all its competitors are nowhere close to where Sublime is right now.</p><p>Bottoms up! Now time to wait for May 9th to see how many of them actually won the award.</p></article><article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article><h2 class=link__title><a class=link__title--link href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=236298">Font-face saga of Chrome</a></h2><p>Apparently, Google Chrome has been infected with a wierd bug that causes web fonts to randomly disappear and fallback to the default system fonts. Initially, I thought I was the only one facing this problem, becuase either hovering the text or reloading the page solved the issue.</p><p>But after stumbling across this <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=236298">bug tracker</a>, I realised that this bug not only affects me (I am on OS X Mavericks) but all other platforms as well. <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2014/02/04/chrome-bug-affecting-web-fonts/">Typekit also clarified</a> that this nothing to do with their font rendering service.</p><p>I am surprised that this issue crept through the stable release channel of both M31 and M32. Although it is not a security or stability issue, this bug affects the quality of text and it just so happens that we really need text on the Web!</p><blockquote><p>The Chrome team is aware of the problem and has already fixed the bug. The bug fix will be in Chrome 33, which is planned for release in late February.

For example, <a href=https://github.com/pankajparashar/pankajparashar.github.io>pankajparashar.github.io</a> is a repository for user pages under my Github username, <a href=https://github.com/pankajparashar>pankajparashar</a>.</p><p>By default, the user pages are available under the url, <code>http://username.github.io</code>.</p><h3>Project pages</h3><p>Project pages are project specific files lying in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of the repository. These pages can be accessed via the url <code>username.github.io/repository_name</code>.</p><p>For example,</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=css><span class=nt>Repository</span> <span class=nt>name</span> <span class=nt>-</span><span class=o>&gt;</span> <span class=nt>Color</span> <span class=nt>Stack</span>

</code></pre></div><h3>Custom domain</h3><p>Now, coming to the meat of the article, custom domain can be set for both user and project pages. Moreover, the steps to setup the domain also remains the same for both the categories. However, this article will only deal with setting up custom domain for the user pages only.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Create the repository <code>username.github.io</code> on Github. For reference, check my <a href=https://github.com/pankajparashar/pankajparashar.github.io>user repository on Github</a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Add a CNAME file containing the custom domain name that you want to map. In my case, the <a href=https://github.com/pankajparashar/pankajparashar.github.io/blob/master/CNAME>CNAME</a> file contains, <code>pankajparashar.com</code></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Login to your domain name registrar and create a <code>A</code> record that maps the domain to the Github's IP address - <code>204.232.175.78</code></p><blockquote><p>There is no guarantee that this IP address will remain the same forever. Indeed, github has changed its value in the past. Presumably github will notify users appropriately before any future changes. If they do change it, you'll have to adjust the configuration at your DNS registrar accordingly.</p></blockquote><p>Theoretically it can take 30 mins to 2 hours for the DNS propagation to complete, but in my experience this change took 1 full day to reflect. Once the propagation is complete, whenever you visit <code>pankajparashar.github.io</code> you will be redirected to my custom domain <code>pankajparashar.com</code>.</p><p>The interesting part is that all the project pages are also being redirected under the same <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain>Top-Level domain</a>. This is fantastic, because for years I have been trying to bring all my projects and the personal website under the same domain. This process makes my entire workflow completely seamless.</p><blockquote><p>My Color Stack project, available at the url <a href=http://pankajparashar.github.io/color-stack>pankajparashar.github.io/color-stack</a> is now automatically being redirected to <a href=http://pankajparashar.github.io/color-stack>pankajparashar.com/color-stack</a>.</p></blockquote><p>By the way, this tweet from <a href=https://twitter.com/jackrugile>@jackrugile</a> triggered me to write this piece,</p><blockquote><p><a href=https://twitter.com/jackrugile>@jackrugile</a> CNAME for user pages only and then the project pages (gh-pages) will automatically appear under the domain name set in the file.</p><br>&mdash; Pankaj Parashar, <a href=https://twitter.com/pankajparashar/statuses/432094472902430721>February 8, 2014</a></blockquote></article><article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article><h2 class=post__title><a class=post__title--link href=/posts/my-frontend-build-tool-wishlist itemprop=name>My frontend build tool wishlist...</a></h2><small class=post__date itemprop=datePublished content="2013-12-21 00:00:00 +0530">Saturday, December 21, 2013</small> <small class=post__time>4.6722222222222225</small><p class=post__excerpt>For quite a long time now, I have been toying around an idea of a perfect build tool to deploy front-end projects. This article is all about my wishlist from such a tool.</p><p>Assuming, you have completed the development work on the frontend of your next web project and are ready to deploy it in production. A typical project involves concatenating and minifying the assets, checking the code for errors, compressing the images and testing it across different combination and breed of browsers, devices and operating system. So, here goes my wishlist,</p><p>The typical build process of a project follows,</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=css><span class=nt>Compilation</span> <span class=o>&gt;</span> <span class=nt>Linting</span> <span class=o>&gt;</span> <span class=nt>Concatenation</span> <span class=o>&gt;</span> <span class=nt>Compression</span> <span class=o>&gt;</span> <span class=nt>Miscellaneous</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Hence, I have divided the build task into the following categories,</p><h3>Compilation</h3><p>If you use some kind of a pre-processor in your workflow to write your HTML, CSS or JavaScript, the compilation of code into its raw form naturally becomes the first step of any build task.</p><ul><li><a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a> / <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">MarkDown</a> / <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> / <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Slim</a> to HTML.</li><li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> / <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> / <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> / <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a> to CSS.</li><li><a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> / <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> to CSS.</li><li><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> / <a href="http://livescript.net/">LiveScript</a> / <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> to JavaScript.</li></ul><h3>Linting</h3><p>Linting refers to validating your code against errors, suspicous code and checking if the code corresponds to a certain style guidelines.</p><ul><li>Lint all <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code> and <code>.js</code> files.</li><li>Should have the ability to configure linting rules and flexiblity to add new style guidelines rules.</li></ul><h3>Concatenation</h3><p>Concatenation combines several files of the same type into a single file so that you can reduce the number of HTTP requests to the server.</p><ul><li>Combining <code>.css</code> and <code>.js</code> files separately with added flexiblity to choose the order in which the files are merged.</li><li>Sprite all background images into a single image file and update the CSS code with the correct background url and position value of each image.</li></ul><h3>Compression</h3><p>Compression helps reduce the overall size of the resource being transferred across the network. Following are some of the ways we can achieve compression,</p><ul><li>Compress all the <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.gif</code> and <code>.svg</code> images with the ability to choose the compression/optimization level.</li><li>Minify the <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code> and the <code>.js</code> document with optional features like add banner, keep special comments and report useful statistics at the end of the process.</li><li>Generate source maps for CSS and JS files to define an exact mapping between the production code and the authored code.</li><li>Remove unused CSS rulesets.</li></ul><h3>Hashing</h3><p>Using hash-ed filenames in addition to the Expiry headers, can help bust the cache without worrying about old assets wreaking havoc on your site.</p><ul><li>Rename assets (<code>.css</code>, <code>.js</code> and images embedded in CSS) with hash-ed filenames to bust the cache and update the references in the source code.</li><li>Hashed filename can be a prefix, suffix or a custom naming pattern scheme.</li><li>It should also have the ability to choose a pre-defined algorithm like <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5>MD5</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1>SHA1</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2>SHA2</a> etc. or a custom algorithm to generate the hash value.</li><li>An added flexibility to define the number of characters, salt of the output value.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><p>Some of the tasks that do not belong to any of the aforementioned categories are below,</p><ul><li>Add banner at the top of <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code> and <code>.js</code> files indicating the license, author and the version no of the file with the ability to automatically increment the no. after every iteration.</li><li>Resize images to a predetermined width/height to avoid excessive image resize/decode work on the client-side in the browser.</li><li>Generate responsive images on demand at different resolutions for use with <a href=https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill>PictureFill</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/srcset/w3c-srcset/">Srcset</a>.</li><li>Convert longhand CSS declarations to shorthand CSS equivalent.</li><li>Automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS properties.</li><li>Arrange CSS properties in alphabetical order to <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/02/csscomb-tool-sort-css-properties/">improve the performance of the selector</a>.</li><li>Convert assets like images and fonts to their equivalent base64 encoded data uris with the ability to choose the threshold size <code>(~4kb)</code>.</li><li>Integration with unit testing framework like <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a> or <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> or <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a> in a headless browser like <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>.</li><li>Automatically push static assets (like images) embedded in HTML directly to CDN (like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> or <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a> and update the new url in the source files.</li><li>Automatically generate device screenshots on various combination of browsers and operating system via <a href=http://www.browserstack.com/screenshots/api>BrowserStack's Screenshot API</a>.</li><li>Run through Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/">Pagespeed Optimizer API</a> and the <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/">Pingdom Tools API</a> to gather Network Utilisation, Web Page Performance audit and other useful statistics that helps you gather significant information about the performance of your website.</li><li>Identify all the links (both external/internal) that no-longer exists or doesn't return HTTP 200.</li><li>Generate documentation of the entire project supported with CSS Style Guides and JavaScript functions.</li></ul><h3>Grulp Project</h3><p>I understand that no build tool would ever be able to meet the outrageous demands of the list above. However, I started with a <a href=https://github.com/pankajparashar/grulp>project on Github</a> to compile a list of ready-to-use grunt/gulp plugins that accomplishes most of the tasks.</p><p><figure><img alt=Grulp src=http://res.cloudinary.com/dw9fem4ki/image/upload/v1391875671/Grulp_d1t3u6.png style="border-bottom: 1px solid #eee; padding: 0 0 0 0em"><figcaption><a href=https://github.com/pankajparashar/grulp>Grulp</a> - List of ready-to-use grunt/gulp plugins to build your next web project.</figcaption></figure></p></article><article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article><h2 class=link__title><a class=link__title--link href=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors>CSS Selectors Level 3</a></h2><p>A Selector represents a structure that can be used as a condition to determine which elements a selector matches in the document tree.</p><p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/almanac/">CSS-Tricks Almanac</a> is an alternative resource to read more about the CSS Selectors and Properties.</p><p><a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors>Checkout the W3C Draft</a></p></article><article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article><h2 class=link__title><a class=link__title--link href=https://gist.github.com/pankajparashar/6752823>Effective shorthand CSS techniques</a></h2><p>There is no official guide for each and every CSS shorthand property.

Continue reading my musings about using a pre-processing tool for a language like CSS.</p><p>For the past few months I have been struggling to convince myself to switch to a CSS preprocessing language like <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> or <a href="http://www.lesscss.org/">LESS</a>. But on the contrary, I ended up documenting the reasons for not using a CSS preprocessor. Here’s why,</p><blockquote><p>Since, the time I wrote this article, I've moved on to use SCSS as my primary pre-processing language, due to its ability to understand plain CSS as well. I don't use all the features offered by SCSS, but use only few of them like variables, mixins, nesting etc. that helps me write better CSS.<br><br><span style=text-align:left;display:block>– November 23, 2013</span></p></blockquote><h3>Another language to write CSS?</h3><p>CSS preprocessor is just another language to write CSS. It takes you away from the simplicty of CSS. Moreover, if it gets into your head then there is every chance that one day you might forget the CSS syntax altogether.</p><p>I realized this problem when I started using the Sass with <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> (that provides readymade add-ons) to use the <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/box_shadow/">mixin for box-shadow</a> by simply passing the parameters.</p><p>The mixin works wonderfully well, but wait! did I forget how to write the CSS for box-shadow? Agreed that care has been taken to keep the syntax similar, but who really wants to learn a new language that essentially gives the output in CSS?</p><h3>Losing the bigger picture</h3><p>Writing pure CSS always brings me closer to the fact that how simple this language is. I write my HTML and JavaScript keeping in mind the simplicity that css can offer. This ensures that my CSS is always used for the presentational aspects only, whereas the complexities are dealt by JavaScript.</p><p><figure><img src=https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/fit/t/1800/756/0*MIhIq2HVG_osB0mU.jpeg></figure></p><p>However, the variables, mixins, extends, nesting etc., in preprocessors forces us to define our approach to write CSS in a programmatic manner rather than aesthetic one. Hence, it is easier to get carried away and lose the bigger picture, isn’t it?</p><h3>Bloated output CSS file</h3><p>Pundits will quickly discard this point as almost every CSS preprocessing tool on this earth is capable of minifying the output CSS. However, the final file size has more to do with the code written inside the file than just gzip and minification.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://blog.millermedeiros.com/the-problem-with-css-pre-processors/">Studies</a> have proved that preprocessors have the tendency of generating redundant snippets of code, when the actual css could have been much smaller.</p></blockquote><p>Lea Verou explains this phenomenon with examples in her <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2011/03/on-css-preprocessors/">opinionated article on CSS preprocessors</a>.</p><h3>Needs additional setup</h3><p>I write my CSS in either Notepad or Vim. The editor and the browser are the only 2 pieces of software that I use for front-end development.</p><p>I don’t want to add additional tools or libraries to my existing workflow. I prefer to keep my workflow light and portable that allows me to work on my code literally from anywhere on any operating system. But preprocessors flirt with this principle since they cannot work without additional toolset like - <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> (for Sass on Windows) and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node PM</a> (for LESS).</p><h3>Maintenance and Debugging</h3><p>For a team of CSS developers, do you really expect each one of them to know Sass/LESS? If no, then what happens if another developer wants to edit the CSS file but doesn’t know Sass?</p><p>Debugging is even harder; when you know that the developer tool of the browser shows you the code and the line number of the css file. Do you want to manually trace the piece of code in your Sass file?</p><p>I do understand the advantages and the benefits that these preprocessors bring to the plate, but with an additional cost. There are counter-arguments probably to every point that I have made in this article. But that still wouldn’t change my opinion and the way I feel about CSS Preprocessors.</p><blockquote><p>I don’t hate them but I don’t like them either!</p></blockquote></article><article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article><h2 class=link__title><a class=link__title--link href="http://speckyboy.com/2012/10/30/getting-to-grips-with-the-html5-file-api/">Getting to grips with the HTML5 File API</a></h2><p>This article demonstrates the basic usage of the HTML5 File APIs to do common tasks like reading the properties and content of the files.</p><blockquote><p>The HTML5 File API allows developers to interact with the local filesystem on the client-side.
