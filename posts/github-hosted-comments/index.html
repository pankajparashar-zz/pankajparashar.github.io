<p>Although a bit old, <a href="http://ivanzuzak.info/">Ivan Zuzak</a> has written about an interesting concept of using comments in issue tracker of Github hosted blog repository.</p><p>Before, starting this blog, I experimented with various techniques to support comments on blog post, but never thought about this unique concept. I am surprised that this technique hasn't become popular despite it coming to the fore almost 3yrs ago.</p><p>I'll definitely consider them to use it on my blog, someday in future.</p>
