<p>I'm glad that the <a href=http://wiki.csswg.org/main>CSS working group</a> wiki compiled a list of mistakes that were made in the design of CSS and are willing to correct if anyone invents a time machine. My favorite one's are,</p><ul><li><code>rgba()</code> and <code>hsla()</code> should not exist, <code>rgb()</code> and <code>hsl()</code> should have gotten an optional fourth parameter for opacity.</li><li>The <code>currentcolor</code> keyword should have a dash, <code>current-color</code>.</li><li>Box-sizing should be border-box by default.</li><li><code>background-size</code> with one value should duplicate its value, not default the second one to <code>auto</code>.</li><li><code>white-space: nowrap</code> should be <code>white-space: no-wrap</code>.</li></ul><p>It is very easy to screw things up, even for design decisions made to build a language used on the web that literally affects the entire world. But it takes a great deal of courage to acknowledge the mistakes commited in the past and develop a genuine intention to resolve them.</p><p>Hence, I laud the working group members for this!</p>
