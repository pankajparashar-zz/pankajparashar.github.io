[Jack Morgan](http://jackwmorgan.com) did an awesome job in redesigning the brand and identity of 
[Squared](http://www.wearesquared.com/) also known as **We are Squared** for Google. In this article, Jack will take you 
through the brainstorming process of designing a logo with great depth in an attempt to create something brutally simple, 
yet tastefully inspriing and instantly recognisable.

> Almost a year after publishing this case study, Jack [rebranded](http://jackwmorgan.com/rebranding-google-squared/) the Google Squared logo with a completely different approach by incorporating the nuances cultivated by the students at the Square center.
