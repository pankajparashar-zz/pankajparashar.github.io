The awesome folks at [Webucator](https://www.webucator.com/) converted my article on [Regular Expressions in Python](http://pankajparashar.com/posts/python-regular-expressions/)
into a training video which can be found [here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28U0HvkIG8). I particularly liked the 
concept of transforming an article into a full length training video and I must say that Webucator has done an incredible job.

Webucator also offers customized Python training for public online classes and self-paced Python courses for individual 
students on its [website](https://www.webucator.com/programming/python.cfm). I couldn't be more happier to recommend them not
just for learning Python but a bunch of other languages as well that they have to offer.
