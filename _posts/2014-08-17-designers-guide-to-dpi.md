I wish I had seen this much earlier in my career, but nevertheless it is better to be late than never. 
All thanks to [Sebastien Gabriel](http://sebastien-gabriel.com/) for putting up this amazing guide for learning
more about cross-DPI and cross-platform design from the very beginning.

Sebastien is a visual designer at Google Chrome and it should come as no surprise given the quality and depth of the 
article. I am sure reading this article can only make you a better designer and would help you make better decisions 
the next time you design pixels and adapct them for various devices.
