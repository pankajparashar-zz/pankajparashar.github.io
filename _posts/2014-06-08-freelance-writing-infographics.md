<p>Coming up with a cost of an article youâ€™re writing as a guest author for some fancy blog could be quite tricky! Largely because you are unaware of the standard rates charged by fellow technical writers in the developer community and either parties do not want to end up on the losing side.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="http://expand2web.com">Expand2Web</a> saved us by designing an infographics that aims to address all the queries and conveniently categorizes the cost based on various parameters that will potentially help you make up your mind.</p>
