Over the weekend, I dished out a realtime in-browser code editor, perfect for
collaborating online with other developers. It can also be used to as a whiteboard
to interview candidates distanced by geographical location. As far as the technology
stack is concerned,

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is the backend.
- [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) is used to establish real-time communication across users.
- HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript constitutes the front-end.
