Although a bit old, [Ivan Zuzak](http://ivanzuzak.info/) has written about an 
interesting concept of using comments in issue tracker of Github hosted blog 
repository.

Before, starting this blog, I experimented with various techniques to support 
comments on blog post, but never thought about this unique concept. I am
surprised that this technique hasn't become popular despite it coming to the 
fore almost 3yrs ago.

I'll definitely consider them to use it on my blog, someday in future.
