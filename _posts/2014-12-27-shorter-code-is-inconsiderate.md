[Allan Reyes](https://twitter.com/allanbreyes) wrote an extremely pertinent article describing the pitfalls of writing 
concise code with the intention of prematurely optimizing the code but ending up making life difficult for everyone. 
Few downsides discussed in the article accompanied by examples,

- Debugging is difficult.
- Readability is completely non-existent.
- Wasting time perfecting and complicating a straight forward code.
- Additional time involved in unobfuscating a perfectly unreasonable code.

The following quote stands out in the article and thus proves that **Shorter code is indeed inconsiderate**,

> Don't be a prick! Write readable code and write it for others.
