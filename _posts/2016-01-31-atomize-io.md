**Atomize** is now the new **Optimize** in the frontend development domain. Atomize.io
is a handy little tool to check how much your website can benefit from the adoption of

If you don't know what Atomic CSS is, then I would strongly recommend
checking [its website](http://acss.io/). I've also included direct links to top 25
most popular websites in the world and surprisingly those folks have plenty of work to do!
