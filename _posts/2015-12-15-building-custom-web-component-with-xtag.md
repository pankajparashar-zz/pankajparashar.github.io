After [Google](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and [Mozilla‘s](http://brick.mozilla.io/)
solutions for web components, it is now Microsoft’s turn to enter this space
with their public release of the [X-Tag library](http://x-tag.github.io/). I have turned
this into an article for SitePoint, explaining how to build a Google Map street
view [custom element](http://codepen.io/SitePoint/full/VevVpa) using the X-Tag library.
