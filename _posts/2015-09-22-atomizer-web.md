A web app to generate Atomic CSS from the input markup that uses Atomic classes.
It is based on node.js library, [Atomizer](#) by Yahoo, which is then wired into
a JavaScript library using Browserify.

The latest version also has the ability to specify configuration to generate
custom classes based on the config file. Simply copy-paste the markup on the
left and you'll get the output Atomic CSS on your right.
