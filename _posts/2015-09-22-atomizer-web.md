A web app to generate Atomic CSS from the input markup that uses Atomic classes.
It is based on node.js library, [Atomizer](https://github.com/yahoo/atomizer) by Yahoo, which is then wired into
a JavaScript library using Browserify.

The latest version also has the ability to specify configuration to generate
custom classes based on the configuration file. Simply copy-paste the markup on the
left and you'll get the Atomic CSS output on your right.

**v2 of Atomic CSS has,**  

- A shiny new editor, thanks to [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/)!  
- A preview window, to design in your browser.  
- Ability to copy output to your clipboard, thanks to [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com).
