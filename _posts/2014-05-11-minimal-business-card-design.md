Little old, but [Boris Smus](http://smus.com/) introduced a minimal design concept of a [business card](http://smus.com/minimal-business-card-design/) way back in 2010 that looks incredibly simple but still quite detailed. I immediately, launched Codepen and whipped up an experiment to build this concept using plain-old CSS.
