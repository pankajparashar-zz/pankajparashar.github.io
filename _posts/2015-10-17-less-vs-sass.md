[Matthew Dean](http://lesscss.org/about/#team), a core-team member of Less wrote
an interesting piece, comparing Less with Sass and highlighting important
differences between the design decisions of the two pre-processors. Obviously,
there is no clear winner here!

I've been using Sass, for as long as [I can remember](http://pankajparashar.com/posts/why-do-i-hate-css-preprocessors/)
but the arguments made by Matt in his article are compelling enough for me to
atleast try Less. If you don't believe me, go read his article.
