After a long time, I have finally managed to write an article for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), on my
beloved topic, the **HTML5 meter** element. This time, I've used the HTML5 meter element
to create a password strength meter, indicating the user how easy or difficult
is to crack the password.
