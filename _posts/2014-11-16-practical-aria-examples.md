We all know that [Heydon Pickering](http://www.heydonworks.com/) has been doing some amazing work in the field of accessibility. His next
project shows us how to make native forms and design components that are part of your application accessible to screen readers. 

The results are impressive and I'm surprised how little code is required to make them work. But at the same time this shows how little I know about accessiblity!
