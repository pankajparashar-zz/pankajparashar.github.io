Recently, I've started using [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) to analyze and
improve the performance of my personal website. It allows you to audit your
website against industry benchmarks like [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/?hl=en),
[YSlow](http://yslow.org/) etc. and also provides a video and a filmstrip to
demonstrate the perceived rendering of your website.

I'm very happy about the results with benchmarks running close to 100%, page
loading under half-a-second and significantly smaller payload.
